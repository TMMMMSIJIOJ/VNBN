                     In this article, you will learn why your 深VPN | SHEN VPN subscription is showing up as expired. <br> <br>

 

Finally, you decided to get that 深VPN | SHEN VPN subscription you've been thinking about. You just paid for your preferred plan, log in for the first time, and see a message that your subscription has expired. Frustration is flowing everywhere. Well, don't you worry! We have some answers and solutions to this problem.
<br> <br>
 

First of all, we want to assure you that no further payments will be required, even if you see that you have been charged for your 深VPN | SHEN VPN subscription plan.

 
<br> <br>
We also encourage you not to attempt to purchase more than one time, as this may result in multiple withdraws from your card, which later will be reverted to your bank account.

 
<br> <br>
Let's go through some potential causes for this to happen and how to fix them:

 <br> <br>

Your bank has declined the transaction<br>
The payment has not gone through yet<br>
Try different payment methods<br>
<br> 
<br> <br>
Your bank has declined the transaction
 <br>

It's possible that you don't have international payments allowed either on your card or your bank account. This means that your bank will not let your payment go through, as it will be canceled. 

 

International payments can easily be enabled by contacting your bank and simply asking them to enable the feature for you.

 
<br> <br>
The payment has not gone through yet
 <br>

It usually takes some time for the payment to fully go through, meaning your account has not yet been activated, even though you made a payment. It might take up to an hour for the payment to go through, so if you see that your subscription is expired after paying for it, give it an hour or so and check once more.

 
<br> <br>
Try different payment methods
 <br>

Lastly, we recommend trying different payment methods, as we have many options to choose from.

 <br><br>

Also, if you have tried purchasing with a mobile device, and your payment was reverted to you, or it didn't go through in the first place, try purchasing a subscription on our website here.

                     Verification of payments may take up to 40 minutes (usually less), and your account might be inactive until they are processed. When you purchase a 深VPN | SHEN VPN subscription, you don't need any additional activation, and your account will become active as soon as our system accepts the payment.

 <br><br>

If there is a message asking you to pay again and there are no payments on your account or your plan is inactive, it can also mean that your transaction did not complete. Therefore, your payment will not go through.

 <br><br>

You can check your account billing history by opening your account page.<br><br>

1. Log into your account<br><br>

2. After logging in, click on Account settings and then - Subscription. You will see your current plan and all of your current payment information below.<br><br>

                    This article will explain what exactly is a Virtual Private Network.<br><br>

 

A VPN is a technology that encrypts your data and routes your internet traffic through specific servers so that your IP address and location are private.<br><br>

 

By using 深VPN | SHEN VPN VPN, you are protecting your privacy online from anyone who might want to snoop on you: from hackers to ISPs (Internet Service Providers) to governments and other third-party organizations. A VPN makes it a lot harder for anyone to monitor the websites you access, files you download, and services you use because all of your data is encrypted.<br><br>

But privacy and security are not all a VPN has to offer! You may have noticed that numerous countries block certain streaming services. This could be due to a variety of reasons, from censorship to location restrictions.<br><br>


Luckily, you can bypass such filters without any extra configurations by connecting to 深VPN | SHEN VPN and diving straight into the internet ocean.<br><br>

And there’s a lot more where that came from! If you’d like to learn more about VPNs and what they have to offer, check out this in-depth blog post.<br><br>

                     This article will explain IP address changes and which locations have the same IP address.<br><br>

Once you connect to a location, you will have the same IP until you reconnect. That is done with the "Round Robin" principle when a new user connects to one of the available servers in random order.
<br><br>
If you wish to have an identical IP each time you connect, you can try connecting to the Static IP locations. These locations always have a single IP address shared among all users currently connected to that specific location.<br><br>

                     In this article, you will learn about the possible speed issues you may encounter and how to deal with them on different devices.<br><br>

 

When you connect to the internet without a VPN, all of your traffic flows from your device to the final destination and then back to you. However, when you use a VPN,  one additional stop along the way is added in the traffic flow, which means that the data goes through a VPN server twice, once on its way out of your device, and once coming back.<br><br>

 

This usually results in a slightly decreased connection speed, as the data has to be processed, and encrypted.<br><br>

 

Usually, internet speed is not highly affected. However, other factors come into play as well, such as:<br><br>

 

The distance between you and the server<br>
The number of users on the same server<br>
The VPN protocol used<br>
Your actual internet speed<br>
 
<br>
These factors might affect the speed even we do not apply any speed or bandwidth limits and keep our servers regularly monitored to maintain optimal performance.<br><br>

If you notice that speed is slower than usual, you can make some minor adjustments to improve it. <br><br>
